The recipe for Carrot Halwa | Gajar Halwais :- 

1. First rinse, peel 650 grams carrots (8 to 9 medium-sized tender juicy carrots or 6 to 7 long carrots).
2. Then grate the carrots either with a hand-held grater or in a food processor. You will need about 4 to 4.5 cups grated carrots.
3. In a heavy kadai, add all of the grated carrots.
4. Pour 4 cups full-fat milk. Switch on the burner.
5. Mix the grated carrots and milk together.
6. Cook this mixture on a low to medium flame. After some minutes, the milk will begin to froth first and then start reducing slowly and slowly.
7. Keep on stirring this halwa mixture often. Keep scraping the sides of the kadai to remove the evaporated milk solids.

Add the milk solids to the cooking mixture. simmer carrots in milk and stir also at intervals, so that the milk does not stick to the bottom of the pan.

16. When the halwa has reduced much and you see a little milk – like that of a pudding consistency. Then add nuts and dry fruits.

You can add your choice of nuts and dry fruits. I have added 12 cashews, 12 almonds and 2 tablespoons golden raisins.

Chop the nuts before you add. Raisins can be kept whole. If using saffron, then you can add at this step.
